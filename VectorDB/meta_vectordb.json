Vector databases (VectorDBs) provide the infrastructure to perform similarity search at scale, enabling applications such as semantic search, recommendation systems, anomaly detection, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This paper discusses the architecture, applications, advantages, and challenges of vector databases.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTraditional databases are designed to handle structured, relational, or document-based data. However, modern AI applications generate embeddings\u2014dense numerical vectors\u2014that capture semantic meaning. Searching in this"}
